This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device.
<br><br>
This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day.

The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

you will find these files:

* activity.csv --> the RAw data for analisys
* code.R --> with all the R code for performing analisys
* PA1_template.html --> this document
* PA1_template.Rmd --> the RMarkdown document that creates "PA1_template.html"


### Obtaining RAW data

The data are originally downloaded from: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

But you can get the file inside the repository, file: **activity.csv**


### libraries used
Here are the main libraries used.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(reshape2)
```

Also it will be necesary to install "impute" library, bacause we need the "impute.knn" function, this is for the k-nearest-neighbors imputation of missing data process. For installing try:

```{r}
# source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") # try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
# biocLite("impute")
library(impute)
```


### setting working directory
use:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("<<your working directory>>")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# setting working directory
setwd("~/Documents/COURSERA_COURSES/Data Science [Especialization]/05-Reproducible Research_Rscripts/week1")
```


### 1) Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

Here we will read the data and introduce new columns for classify weekdays and weekend days.

```{r}
# Reading data
DATA <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# converting to data class
DATA$date <- as.Date(strptime(DATA$date,"%Y-%m-%d"))

# introducing weekdays
DATA$day <- format(DATA$date, "%u") # Weekday as a decimal number (1–7, Monday is 1)
DATA$day2 <- as.factor(weekdays(DATA$date, abbreviate=TRUE))
DATA$weekend <- 0
DATA$weekend[DATA$day == 6 | DATA$day == 7] <- 1
DATA$weekend <- factor(DATA$weekend, levels=c(0,1), labels=c("weekday","weekend"))
```

The variables included in this dataset are:

* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as 𝙽𝙰)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

Here there are a example of the data including new columns (day, day and weekend):
```{r}
head(DATA)
```


### 2) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

For the histogram of steps/day we sum the steps for each day usign ddply function

```{r, fig.align='center'}
DATA.sum.day <- ddply(DATA, .(date), summarize, steps = sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE)) # DATA statistics by day
ggp1 <- ggplot(data=DATA.sum.day, aes(steps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=500)
ggp1 <- ggp1 + xlab("steps/day")
ggp1 <- ggp1 + labs(title = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")
plot(ggp1)
```


### 3) Mean and median number of steps taken each day
Introducing the mean and median to the previous plot
```{r, fig.align='center'}
MEAN <- mean(DATA.sum.day$steps)
MEDIAN <- median(DATA.sum.day$steps)
ggp1 <- ggp1 + geom_vline(xintercept = MEAN, colour="blue")
ggp1 <- ggp1 + geom_text(aes(x=MEAN, y=0, label=paste0("MEAN: ",round(MEAN,1))), colour="blue", size=5, angle=90, hjust=-1, vjust=-0.5)
ggp1 <- ggp1 + geom_vline(xintercept = MEDIAN, colour="cyan")
ggp1 <- ggp1 + geom_text(aes(x=MEDIAN, y=0, label=paste0("MEDIAN: ",round(MEDIAN,1))), colour="cyan", size=5, angle=90, hjust=-1, vjust=-0.5)
plot(ggp1)
```


### 4) Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

The daily mean requires the ddply function for mean ecah day

```{r, fig.align='center'}
DATA.mean.interval <- ddply(DATA, .(interval), summarize, steps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
ggp2 <- ggplot(data=DATA.mean.interval, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line(size=1)
ggp2 <- ggp2 + xlab("5-min interval of each day") + ylab("mean steps/5-min")
ggp2 <- ggp2 + labs(title = "Average of 5-min steps by interval")
plot(ggp2)
```


### 5) The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

Identifiying and plotting the max. num of steps in a 5-min interval

```{r, fig.align='center'}
MAX.interval <- DATA.mean.interval[which.max(DATA.mean.interval$steps), ]
ggp2 <- ggp2 + geom_point(data=MAX.interval, aes(interval, steps), size=2, color="red")
ggp2 <- ggp2 + geom_text(data=MAX.interval, aes(interval, steps, label=paste0("MAX:",round(MAX.interval$steps,1)," steps at interval: ",MAX.interval$interval)), size=4, color="red", hjust=-0.1)
plot(ggp2)
```


### 6) Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
First of all I want to know how many NAs are...
```{r}
# counting number of NA
table(is.na(DATA$steps))

# there are 2304 NAs, that is the 13% of the whole data:
2304/(15264 + 2304)
```
So there are `r (2304/(15264 + 2304))*100`% of NA values

For better comprension of NA values I perform some cast.
```{r}
DATA.cast <- dcast(DATA, date+day+day2+weekend~interval, value.var="steps")
```

We will see that all the NAs are due to full day with no data tracking
```{r}
head(DATA.cast)
```

I will check now if all the NAs are because full day no tracking or there afe days with mixed values and NAs
```{r}
# here we can see that all the 2304 NAs are because full day no data recording (DATA.NA subseting)
DATA.NA <- subset(DATA.cast, is.na(DATA.cast[,5]))
```

So we can see that all the NAs are inside the DATA.NA subtable, so all the NAs are full day no tracking:
```{r}
table(is.na(melt(DATA.NA, id=c("date","day","day2", "weekend"))$value))
```

so my strategy for Imputing missing values is to use impute.knn function:
```{r}
# installing Impute function from Bioconductor.org
# you need this library for doing a k-nearest-neighbors imputation of missing data 
# source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") # try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
# biocLite("impute")
library(impute)

DATA.imputed <- as.data.frame(impute.knn(as.matrix(DATA.cast[,5:NCOL(DATA.cast)]))$data)
DATA.imputed <- cbind(DATA.cast[,1:4], DATA.imputed)
```

At now I melt the DATA.imputed data.frame for easy comparation with original DATA:
```{r}
# melt the data
DATA.imputed <- melt(DATA.imputed, id=c("date","day","day2","weekend"))
colnames(DATA.imputed) <- c("date","day","day2","weekend","interval","steps")
DATA.imputed <- DATA.imputed[,c("steps","date","interval","day","day2","weekend")]
```

head of original DATA:
```{r}
head(DATA)
```


head of DATA.imputed:
```{r}
head(DATA.imputed[order(DATA.imputed$date),])
```


### 7) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
```{r}
DATA.sum.day.imputed <- ddply(DATA.imputed, .(date), summarize, steps = sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE)) # DATA statistics by day
ggp3 <- ggplot(data=DATA.sum.day.imputed, aes(steps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=500)
ggp3 <- ggp3 + xlab("steps/day")
ggp3 <- ggp3 + labs(title = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day (NA data imputed)")
MEAN <- mean(DATA.sum.day$steps)
MEDIAN <- median(DATA.sum.day$steps)
ggp3 <- ggp3 + geom_vline(xintercept = MEAN, colour="blue")
ggp3 <- ggp3 + geom_text(aes(x=MEAN, y=0, label=paste0("MEAN: ",round(MEAN,1))), colour="blue", size=5, angle=90, hjust=-1, vjust=-0.5)
ggp3 <- ggp3 + geom_vline(xintercept = MEDIAN, colour="cyan")
ggp3 <- ggp3 + geom_text(aes(x=MEDIAN, y=0, label=paste0("MEDIAN: ",round(MEDIAN,1))), colour="cyan", size=5, angle=90, hjust=-1, vjust=-0.5)
```

We can see that the histogram changes, but the mean and median don't change from the original data:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(ggp3)
```


### 8) Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
```{r, fig.align='center'}
DATA.mean.interval <- ddply(DATA, .(interval, weekend), summarize, steps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
ggp4 <- ggplot(data=DATA.mean.interval, aes(interval, steps, colour=weekend)) + geom_line(size=1) + facet_grid(weekend~.)
ggp4 <- ggp4 + xlab("5-min interval of each day") + ylab("mean steps/5-min")
ggp4 <- ggp4 + labs(title = "Average of 5-min steps by interval")
plot(ggp4)
```
